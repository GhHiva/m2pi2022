# m2pi2022 Python Course Notes

The resources linked from this repository were used to support the Python course for the 2022 edition of the PIMS Math^Industry workshop. The lecture notes for the numpy and pandas sections are available in the LecureNotes directory (along with some supporting material):

  * [numpy](./LectureNotes/Numpy.ipynb)
  * [pandas](./LectureNotes/Pandas.ipynb)
 
The scikit-learn portion of the course was taught by Matthew Greenberg and his notes are available as a google colab notebook

  * [scikit-learn](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19bFkj9RT0erhjSg_GYFuuXhQmHb_eSsG?usp=sharing)
  
Their intention of these courses is to give m2pi participants a foundation for tackling the industry problems they will face in the following weeks of m2pi. 

The notebooks being added to the ProblemSession directory will build on the material covered in
the lecture notes to allow you to practice what you have learned. They range
from simply pure-python problems in
[AoCProblems.ipynb](./ProblemSession/PythonStdLib/AocProblems.ipynb) to more complex problems utilizing numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. New notebooks will be added to the repository when they are used. Some of the problems include solutions at various stages of completion. You should view these as _possible_ solutions, and you may be able to come up with a better solution (pull requests are welcome!)
