# m2pi2022 Python Course Notes

The notebooks in this directory were used to support the 2022 edition of the PIMS Math^Industry workshop. The LectureNotes directory has some material covering 

  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn

Their intention is to give m2pi participants a foundation for tackling the industry problems they will face in the following weeks of m2pi. 

The notebooks in the ProblemSession directory build on the material covered in
the lecture notes to allow you to practice what you have learned. They range
from simply pure-python problems in
[AoCProblems.ipynb](./ProblemSession/PythonStdLib/AocProblems.ipynb) to fuller
and more complete problems such as
[CarPricing.ipynb](./CarPricing/CarPricing.ipynb). The problems are in various stages of completion and  where solutions to problems
are given, you should view them as _possible_ answers, you may be able to come up with a better solution (pull requests are welcome!)
