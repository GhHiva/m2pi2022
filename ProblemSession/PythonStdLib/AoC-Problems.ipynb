    "Turns out the generate method above only explores a tiny portion of the available space of latin squares. Fortunately some kind people at the NSA have described an algorithm for (approximately) uniform random sampling from the full space of Latin Squares via MCMC. Let's do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first insight J&M give is that each $n\\times n$ latin square is equivalent to an $n\\times n\\times n$ incidence matrix. Great, but what the hell is an incidence matrix? In this context it is a 3D marix where each row (in any dimension) contains exactly $n - 1$ zeros and exactly 1 one. To see the correspondence between this and a latin square, think of labeling each entry of the incidence matrix as $M_{i, j, k}$; If $M_{i, j, k} = 1$, then we write $k$ into the $(i, j)$ position of our latin square. This gives us a 1 to 1 correspondance between latin squares and incidence matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "More mathematically, we represent a latin square as a function $M$ from the set of ordered triples from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$, such that for any $i, j \\in \\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ we have $\\sum_{z}M_{i, j, k} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their next big insight is to define a class of \"almost\" incidence matrices. Given the function definition above, this means that the rows (in all 3 dimensions) which include the $-1$ must include two other $1$ entries so that the sum of all of the values in the row is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These matrices obviously _don't_ correspond to latin squares, but J&M show that together with actual/valid incidence matrices they give us enough freedom tp construct an MCMC which will explore the space of valid incidence matrices (and so latin squares) _with uniform sampling_. To get a random latin square, uniformly distributed in the space of all latin squares, all you need to do is apply these steps and then check that you've landed on a valid incidence matrix. If you haven't you can keep going and check again (there are ~n steps between valid matrices), and these are relatively inexpensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to implementing the MCMC is the transition step. Here is how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $M$ is a valid incidence matrix, choose $i, j, k$ with $M_{i,j,k}=0$; if $M$ is\n",
    "is an almost incidence matrix, start with the unique $i, j, k$ such that $M_{i, j, k} = -1$ \t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let $i', j', k'$ be points such that $M_{i', j, k} = M_{i, j', k} = M_{i, j, k'} = 1$. If $M$ is valid, this choice is unique, if it is almost, there are two pssoble choices for each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now increase the value of $M_{i, j, k}$, $M_{i, j', k'}$, $M_{i', j, k'}$ and $M_{i', j', k}$ by 1, and decrease it by 1 $M_{i', j, k}$. $M_{i, j', k}$, $M_{i, j, k'}$ and $M_{i', j', k'}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will be another actual or almost incidence matrix depending on whether $M_{i', j', k'} = 1$ or $M_{i', j', k'} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If the incidence matrix is valid then select $i, j, k$ of any $0$ entry in the matrix. In the \"almost\" incidence case, select the $i, j, k$, of the $-1$ entry. Next choose $i', j', k'$ such that $M_{i', j, k} =  M_{i, j', k} = M_{i, j, k'} = 1$. In the valid case this choice is unique, in the almost case there will be two choices in each dimension, we randomly select between these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now $i, j, k$ and $i', j', k'$ define a cube within our incidence matrix, the edges of the cube are $\\{i, i'\\}\\times \\{j, j'\\}\\times \\{k, k'\\}$. $M_{i', j, k} = M_{i, j', k} = M_{i, j, k'} = 1$ by construction and from the incidence condition $M_{i', j', k} = M_{i', j, k'} = M_{i, j', k'} = 0$. If the matrix is valid the $M_{i, j, k} = 0$, if it is almost then $M_{i, j, k} = 0$. Finally, $M_{i', j', k'} = 0$ or $M_{i', j', k'} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition step is to add 1 to the element $M_{i, j, k}$, subtract one from the element $M_{i′,j′,k′}$, and toggle the remaining entries. If $M_{i′,j′,k′}$ was 1 this will result in a perfect incidence matrix, if not, it will give an almost incidence matrix."
