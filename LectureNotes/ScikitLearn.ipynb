    "_**Caveat**: Machine learning is a _huge_ topic and I'm not an expert in it. These notes cover some introductory steps and useful tips, but you should augment them with other resources as you learn more. The [scikit-learn tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) is a good place to start, and there are lots of [courses](https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-scikit-learn-online-courses-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-6beb02e9cca0) and [books](https://www.amazon.ca/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hands-on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn%2C+keras%2C+and+tensorflow&qid=1657479285&sprefix=scikit-learn%2Caps%2C425&sr=8-1) available._\n",

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning problems usually start with a (potentially large) collection of data which you want to use to draw inferences from to make predictions. There are two broad categories of machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the data you are learning from comes with the answers: it is _labeled_. The idea is to use this labeling to train your algorithm to make predictions for new data which lack the labels. There are two broad categories of problem where supervised learning is used:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      * **Classification Problems**: where you want to use the data to divide instances into discrete categories (e.g. Logistic Regression)\n",
    "      * **Regression Problems**: where you want to use the data to make some numerical predictions (e.g. Linear Regression)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "  * **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning the learning algorithm has to learn for itself. It has no labels to guide it, only the data. Some of the most common categories or problem tackled with unsupervised learning algorithms are:\n",
    "      * **Clustering**: Recognizing distinct groups within the data (e.g. K-Means)\n",
    "      * **Dimensionality Reduction** Making datasets more tractable while retaining correlations and patterns (e.g. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "      * **Anomoly/Novelty Detection** Finding outliers in your dataset (e.g. One class Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "The landscape of machine learning algorithms is huge and continues to grow, we don't have any hope of covering all of them, but if you can categorize your problem similar to those above, some searching and comparing to existing problems will normally help you narrow down the approaches you want to try. Fortunately scikit-learn provides a consistent interface to many of them and makes it possible to explore and experiment until you find the one(s) you need!\n"

Since `median_income` is an (almost) continuous variable, the idea is to bin the values into categories, then use those categories to sample from."

    "Not great, not terrible. This is saying our predictions are off by around ~\\\\$60000 for this model. Ideally though, we want to get an idea of how reliable that figure is before proceeding. One way to do this is to hold out some more of our training data for this evaluation (remember we don't want to touch our actual test data until the very end). We could do this a bunch of times, using different segments of the training data and the look at how the root mean square error varies. That's the basic idea behind sklearn's K-fold cross validation feature. We will do a 10 fold cross validation for our model which will split the training data into 10 folds. The model will be trained 10 times in total using 9 of these folds as the training data and the remaining one to evaluate the model"
